\section{Introduction}

The Influence of IoT-Devices in everyday life has been rising for decades.
Connected devices are expected to number 20 billion \parencite{gartner0} by 2020 in nearly every industry.
According to \parencite{verizon} the use of media and entertainment on digital devices increased by 120 \% in 2016 compared to 2013,
the industry was third in terms of accepting IoT,
with manufacturing (204\%) and finance and insurance (138\%) industries topping the chart.

Within the entertainment industry, escape rooms have been a growing sector since the first escape room launched 2007 in Japan.
Escape rooms generally follow the same structure: People are locked into a room, have to solve riddles,
and get out in a defined period or will be freed by a supervisor who watches the process to support
and step in in case of an emergency.

This field offers lots of possibilities for technical development, be it the use of different sensors, the use of Virtual Reality or flexible story-telling (depending on the users actions).
In this thesis, my goal was to make the first step to a smart escape room.

The faculty provided an escape room with micro-controllers as riddles.
The room provided support for the existing riddles but provided little support for changes.
This thesis will focus on developing an easy integration system for new riddles from different devices.
Furthermore, a User Interface which supports communication with existing and new riddles dynamically was developed.
The second chapter will provide an overview about our research on topics relevant for this project. 
The third chapter will analyze the escape rooms architecture concerning our research. 
The fourth chapter will explain in further detail how the project was implemented. 
Chapter five will evaluate the implementation and examine future possibilites for the project.
