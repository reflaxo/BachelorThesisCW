	Abstract = {The Internet is continuously changing and evolving. The main communication form of present Internet is human-human. The Internet of Things (IoT) can be considered as the future evaluation of the Internet that realizes machine-to-machine (M2M) learning. Thus, IoT provides connectivity for everyone and everything. The IoT embeds some intelligence in Internet-connected objects to communicate, exchange information, take decisions, invoke actions and provide amazing services. This paper addresses the existing development trends, the generic architecture of IoT, its distinguishing features and possible future applications. This paper also forecast the key challenges associated with the development of IoT. The IoT is getting increasing popularity for academia, industry as well as government that has the potential to bring significant personal, professional and economic benefits.},

	Abstract = {Currently, a large number of smart objects and different types of devices are interconnected and communicate via Internet Protocol that creates a worldwide ubiquitous and pervasive network called the Internet of Things (IoT). With an increase in the deployment of smart objects, IoT is expected to have a significant impact on human life in the near future. A majorbreakthrough in bridging the gap between virtual and physical worlds came from the vision of the Web of Things (WoT), which employs open Web standards in achieving information sharing and objects interoperability. Social Web of Things (SWoT) further extends WoT to integrate smart objects with social networks and is observed to not only bridge between physical and virtual worlds but also facilitate continued interaction between physical devices and human. This makes SWoT the most promising approach and has now become an active research area. This survey introduces necessary background and fundamentals to understand current efforts in IoT, WoT and SWoT by reviewing key enabling technologies. These efforts are investigated in detail from several different perspectives such as architecture design, middleware, platform, systems implementation, and application in hand. Moreover, a large number of platforms and applications are analyzed and evaluated from various alternatives have become popular during the past decade. Finally, we address associated challenges and highlight potential research to be perused in future.},

The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
